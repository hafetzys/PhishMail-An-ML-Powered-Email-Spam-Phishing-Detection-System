## Project Title: PhishMail: An ML-Powered Email Spam & Phishing Detection System

## Core Objective: To build a system that can analyze the content and metadata of an email to classify it as Legit (legitimate), Spam, or Phishing.

## Defining the "Threat":

Spam: Unsolicited bulk messages, often commercial.
Phishing: A targeted type of spam designed to trick the recipient into revealing sensitive information. This is a more sophisticated threat.

## Tech Tools
Core Language: Python
ML Library: Scikit-learn (perfect for this). TensorFlow/Keras can be used for a neural network or text-specific models.
Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
NLP & Text Processing: NLTK, spaCy (for advanced NLP like lemmatization), Scikit-learn's CountVectorizer & TfidfVectorizer.
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud (great for visualizing spam vs. ham words).
Application & Deployment: Flask/FastAPI

## Project Flow

Phase 0: Foundation & Setup (Week 1)
Phase 0 Objective: Set up your development environment and project structure.
- 0.1: Create Github Repository for this project
- 0.2: Set up local environment (Anaconda GUI)
- 0.3: Plan Project Structure
- 0.4: Initialize Version Control

Phase 1: Data Acquisition & Understanding (Week 1-2)
Phase 1 Objective: Secure a dataset and perform initial exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Phase 2: Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering (Week 2-3)
Phase 2 Objective: Clean the raw text data and transform it into features suitable for ML models.

Phase 3: Model Training & Evaluation (Week 3-4)
Phase 3 Objective: Train multiple machine learning models, evaluate them, and select the best one.

Phase 4: Productionizing the Model (Week 4-5)
Phase 4 Objective: Move from notebooks to production-ready code and build a simple application.

Phase 5: Documentation & Portfolio Polish (Week 5)
Phase 5 Objective: Make your project accessible and understandable to anyone
